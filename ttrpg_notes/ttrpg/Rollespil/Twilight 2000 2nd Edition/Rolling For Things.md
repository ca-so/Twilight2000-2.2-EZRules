So to roll for things, a few things need to be calculated and given a challenge rating first.
### Assets
This feels like a weird name for what a character can do, but we roll with it.

To find your characters assets, you take a skills value together with the controlling attributes value.
For example, if a character has a Strength of 7 and a Heavy Weapons of 3, that total asset would be 10.

Both the skills value and the asset should be written together on the character sheet.

So when you are told to make a roll of Heavy Weapons, you would use your asset number, I.E. 10. (Unless stated otherwise, but that happens more rarely)
### Difficulty Of Tasks
There are multiple shades of difficulty. These are:
Easy
Average
Difficult
Formidable
Impossible (Note, this one just means really hard not actually impossible)
#### Automatic Tasks:
These are just tasks that the referee decides are so easy or has been done enough times, that there is no need for a roll.
Like driving down a short stretch of road in clear weather.

#### Task Modifiers:
When doing a task, you are told the difficulty. This difficulty adds a modifier to your asset level, as shown in this graph:
![[task_difficulty_levels.png]]

#### Determining Success:
Once difficulty and the relevant asset has been determined, it is time to roll!
Roll 1D20 and compare the rolled number to the calculated asset level. If the rolled number is equal to or lower than the asset level, the task is successful! If it is above, the task has failed.

For example, if a character has a Strength of 7 and a Heavy Weapons of 3, that total asset would be 10.
The task is average, therefore making the total number be 20.
A D20 is rolled and it is a 7, therefore making it a success.
If the difficulty instead had been formidable, the total number would be 5, and the roll would have failed.

If you at any time roll a natural 1, the task is an automatic success.
If you roll a 20 however, it is an automatic failure.

#### Unskilled Tasks
If your character is trying to do a task that they do not have any levels in, you roll with disadvantage.
This is a straight attribute roll and the task modifier becomes one difficulty harder.

Taking our example from before, if our character did not have a Heavy Weapons skill of 3 but instead had no levels in it and was rolling against a difficulty task of Easy, the task would become Average and they would have to roll 14 or under to succeed.

#### Skill Level 0
A skill level of 0 means that the character is a little familiar with the subject and therefore does not gain the unskilled penalty.

#### More Than One Asset
Sometimes more than one asset can be used to do a skill roll.
This can be done in one of four ways.

Combined Skills:
A task may require two assets, like repairing a generator might require both Mechanic and Electronics.
In this scenario, the smaller of the two assets is chosen to use in the skill roll.

Alternative Skills:
Sometimes, a task can be done multiple ways. Like determining if an animal is dead can be done with both Biology and Medical.
In this scenario, the higher of the two assets is chosen.

Averaged Skills:
Sometimes two skills compliment each other for the task.
When this happens, put the two asset values together and divide by 2, rounding down.
No more than two skills can be used at a time for averaged skill checks.

Enabling Skills:
I don't understand this one and don't plan on using it..

#### Opposition
