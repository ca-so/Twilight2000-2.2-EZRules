So to roll for things, a few things need to be calculated and given a challenge rating first.
### Assets
This feels like a weird name for what a character can do, but we roll with it.

To find your characters assets, you take a skills value together with the controlling attributes value.
For example, if a character has a Strength of 7 and a Heavy Weapons of 3, that total asset would be 10.

Both the skills value and the asset should be written together on the character sheet.

So when you are told to make a roll of Heavy Weapons, you would use your asset number, I.E. 10. (Unless stated otherwise, but that happens more rarely)
### Difficulty Of Tasks
There are multiple shades of difficulty. These are:
Easy
Average
Difficult
Formidable
Impossible (Note, this one just means really hard not actually impossible)
#### Automatic Tasks:
These are just tasks that the referee decides are so easy or has been done enough times, that there is no need for a roll.
Like driving down a short stretch of road in clear weather.

#### Task Modifiers:
When doing a task, you are told the difficulty. This difficulty adds a modifier to your asset level, as shown in this graph:
![[task_difficulty_levels.png]]

#### Determining Success:
Once difficulty and the relevant asset has been determined, it is time to roll!
Roll 1D20 and compare the rolled number to the calculated asset level. If the rolled number is equal to or lower than the asset level, the task is successful! If it is above, the task has failed.

For example, if a character has a Strength of 7 and a Heavy Weapons of 3, that total asset would be 10.
The task is average, therefore making the total number be 20.
A D20 is rolled and it is a 7, therefore making it a success.
If the difficulty instead had been formidable, the total number would be 5, and the roll would have failed.

If you at any time roll a natural 1, the task is an automatic success.
If you roll a 20 however, it is an automatic failure.

#### Unskilled Tasks
If your character is trying to do a task that they do not have any levels in, you roll with disadvantage.
This is a straight attribute roll and the task modifier becomes one difficulty harder.

Taking our example from before, if our character did not have a Heavy Weapons skill of 3 but instead had no levels in it and was rolling against a difficulty task of Easy, the task would become Average and they would have to roll 14 or under to succeed.

#### Skill Level 0
A skill level of 0 means that the character is a little familiar with the subject and therefore does not gain the unskilled penalty.

#### More Than One Asset
Sometimes more than one asset can be used to do a skill roll.
This can be done in one of four ways.

Combined Skills:
A task may require two assets, like repairing a generator might require both Mechanic and Electronics.
In this scenario, the smaller of the two assets is chosen to use in the skill roll.

Alternative Skills:
Sometimes, a task can be done multiple ways. Like determining if an animal is dead can be done with both Biology and Medical.
In this scenario, the higher of the two assets is chosen.

Averaged Skills:
Sometimes two skills compliment each other for the task.
When this happens, put the two asset values together and divide by 2, rounding down.
No more than two skills can be used at a time for averaged skill checks.

Enabling Skills:
I don't understand this one and don't plan on using it..
It is on page 136 if anyone wants to write it out here for future use.

#### Opposition
In some cases, two character might be competing or working against each other during a task. This is handled one of three ways.

The first way is when two characters are working directly against each other, like one is trying to push open a door, while another is trying to hold it closed.
In this case the asset used is the attempting characters asset minus the opposing characters asset.
If the calculated asset equal 0 or lower, the opposing character automatically wins.

The second way, is when two characters are competing to complete a task first, that is possible to fail. Like trying to solve a math problem, to see who is fastest.
Here they both roll as normal, and the one lowest beneath their asset score, wins.
If it is a tie, roll again. If one or both fail, it is decided like that.

The third case, is one where one has to succeed. Like a footrace.
The characters roll as above. If both fail, the one who is closest to succeeding, wins.

#### Outstanding Success And Catastrophic Failure
Outstanding success:
This is when a character succeeds a roll by beating it with 10 or more.
So if your asset number is 20 and you roll a 9, that is an outstanding success.
When this happens, the GM will make something extra good happen.

Catastrophic failure:
This is when a character fails a roll by 10 or more.
When this happens, you roll again against the same asset. If they fail again, it is a catastrophic failure and something bad happens.
If you succeed the second roll, it is just a normal failure.

#### Time Required
This is determined by the referee. However a outstanding success or a catastrophic failure might increase or decrease the taken necessary to complete the task.

#### Uncertain Tasks
Sometimes a player will not know immediately if a task succeeded or not. This is up to the referee to determine what happens

Here is one way to decide what happens mentioned in the [Core Rulebook PDF](Twilight%202000%20-%20Corebook%20-%20Core%20Rulebook%20v2.2%20{GDW2000}.pdf) :
Both the player and the referee roll against the asset, the referees roll being hidden.
If both fail the result is no truth be told or nothing good happens, like an NPC lying to them or the motor the character just repaired, breaks down.

If only one fails, a half truth is given.
Here the players know they failed, but the NPC might not lie or tell them something somewhat truthful.

If both succeed, a full truth is given.
Here the players know they succeeded, but may not know what the referee rolled, thereby not knowing if it is 100% correct or there is some lie to what is being told.
The referee will however tell them the correct information.
