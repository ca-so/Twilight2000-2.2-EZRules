So, now that you have a character, how do you level up?
How does one improve upon themselves (╭ರ_•́)
# Levelling Up
You gain experience points that are then used to buy upgrades in certain skills.

One experience point = one level.
So if you wanted to upgrade a skill from level 4 to level 5, you would need to spend 5 experience points.

You can buy multiple levels at once, but the calculation for the cost is the same.
So if you wanted to go from level 3 to level 5, it would cost
4 + 5 = 9 experience points.

Experience points may also be saved for a later time.

The time to level up is chosen at the referee's discretion, like after a session or when the characters make camp.

# Gaining Experience Points
After each session, one experience point is awarded to all players, and a bonus point for each skill that was dangerous to use or a skill that was used a lot.

Bonus points may be given to players who were particularly good at staying in character or performed a particularly heroic deed during the session

# Initiative
A separate point system for levelling up initiative exists.
One point is awarded after each gunfight, awarding extra points for a particularly good shot or impressive hand-to-hand combat.

These initiative points work like the experience points, but can only be used to upgrade experience.
