So, now that you have a character, how do you level up?
How does one improve upon themselves (╭ರ_•́)
# Levelling Up
You gain experience points that are then used to buy upgrades in certain skills.

One experience point = one level.
So if you wanted to upgrade a skill from level 4 to level 5, you would need to spend 5 experience points.

You can buy multiple levels at once, but the calculation for the cost is the same.
So if you wanted to go from level 3 to level 5, it would cost
4 + 5 = 9 experience points.

Experience points may also be saved for a later time.

The time to level up is chosen at the referee's discretion, like after a session or when the characters make camp.

# Gaining Experience Points
After each session, one experience point is awarded to all players, and a bonus point for each skill that was dangerous to use or a skill that was used a lot.

Bonus points may be given to players who were particularly good at staying in character or performed a particularly heroic deed during the session

# Initiative
A separate point system for levelling up initiative exists.
One point is awarded after each gunfight, awarding extra points for a particularly good shot or impressive hand-to-hand combat.

These initiative points work like the experience points, but can only be used to upgrade experience.

# Advancing By Observation
Some tasks can give extra experience points, if they are observed while being performed.
An observing character can only gain an experience point however, if the performing characters used skill is at least twice that of the observing characters.
The task will also take longer to do, at the referee's discretion.

# Advancing By Instruction
A character may teach another a skill, thereby granting them an experience point.

The teacher may teach any amount of characters, equal to their Instruction skill.
A teacher cannot teach a skill to a character who's skill is equal to or greater than the teachers.

To teach a skill is a Difficult task and must be rolled as such.
Teaching a skill takes one period per day, for one week.
The die is then rolled to see if the lessons were useful.

If the lesson was successful, both the teacher and the student(s) gain experience points.
Students gain skill point based on the number of students.
Teachers gain 1 experience point.

If the number of students is less than half of the teachers Instruction skill, each student gain 3 experience points.

If the number of students is equal to or greater than the teachers Instruction skill, each student gain 1 experience point.

# New Skills
A character who does not have any experience in a skill, can attempt to learn it two ways.

One way being through observation. If successful, the chosen skill is now level 0.

The other way is through instruction. If successful, the chosen skill is now level 1.

Whichever way is chosen, upgrading the skill will still cost 1 experience point.
