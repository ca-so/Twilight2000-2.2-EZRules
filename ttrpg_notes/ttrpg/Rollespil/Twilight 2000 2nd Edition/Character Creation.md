This is what we have to go through to create a character:
- Background: Decide on nationality, gender and name
- Attributes: Find characters stats with either rolled or point-buy
- Experience: Simulate your characters life from 17 years old and forward
- Derived values: The last stats are calculated
- Equipment: What gear your character has collected over the years

# Background
The first thing to do is name your character and what gender you will be.

## Nationality and army
What nationality you choose decides which languages you might be able to speak, so choose carefully.
Here you can see what languages you get from the different nationalities:
![[languages_for_nationalities.png]]

The first language in the column is your native language. You receive an automatic 10 in that language and can add that to your character sheet.
Now you can see if you get any additional languages.
You go from top to bottom through the potential languages and roll 1d10. You keep doing this either until you succeed in one language or fail all potential languages.
You succeed by rolling the displayed number or below.
If you succeed, you get a 10 in that language and can add it to your character sheet.

You then choose an army appropriate for your nationality. You can have a different nationality than what army you are in (ex. be Italian but be in the U.S. Army).
Just make sure to clear it with your GM first.

## Soviet nationalities and army
I got to be honest, I don't understand the rules for how Soviet stuff works. If you want to play as that, we can figure something out together

# Attributes
Each character is described by six attributes: Strength, Agility, Constitution, Charisma, Intelligence and Education.
These can be determined either with a point-buy system or by rolling

## Point-buy
When using point-buy, you have a total of 32 points to distribute over your characters attributes.
No attribute can have a value of 0 or higher than 10.
## Random Generation
For each attribute, roll 2d6-2 and reroll any roll that would result in a stat being 0.
You can choose yourself if you want to move the stats around or randomly generate in order.
## Increasing Attributes And Meaning
Attributes may be permanently changed during the experience part of character creation but do not change (only temporarily) as a result of gameplay.
No attribute may be increased by more than 2 during the experience part of character creation, making the highest possible stat = 12.

Strength: How big your muscles are
Agility: Your coordination and nimbleness
Constitution: Health and stamina
Intelligence: How quickly you learns. Is **NOT** the same thing as common sense
Education: How far you are able to get in an academic setting
Charisma: How attractive and trustworthy you are

# Experience
Okay, this one is a bit harder to explain properly.

A few things:
A background consists of a formal education and/or one or more careers.

Backgrounds are calculated in periods of 4 year terms.

A character can enter any career that they meet the requirements for, but they have to spend a full term doing that thing, before being able to change career.

### Step 1:
Your character starts out as 17 years old. You pick 4 skills from the following list and receive 2 levels in each. 
Add this to your character sheet.
![[background_skill_list.png]]
### Step 2:
You pick any career that your character meets the requirements for and work in that career for as many terms as you want, given that war does not break out.
For the 1st term in a career, your character gains a fixed amount of skill levels. In the following terms in the same career, they gain bonus skill levels that they freely can distribute between the available skills, as show in this picture:

![[term_skill_levels.png]]
*There are some additional rules for these extra skill levels, but I have decided that they are too complicated for no reason. They have therefore been removed.*

Will eventually upload pictures here, but you can in the meantime find it on page 31 in the core rulebook PDF.

### Step 3:
Once you have chosen a career and a secondary activity, added all the stats from that term, it is time to roll to see if you get promoted! (If you are in the military that is)
A character is eligible for promotion once per term

### Secondary Activities
Your characters career does not take up 100% of their time.
Most careers allow 1 secondary activity.
Some allow none and some allow 2.
This allows the player to take one level in any skill on the following list

![[secondary_activities.png]]
### Languages
Why this rule exists, I do not know..

Any skill level received in a language in the same group as your native tongue, is doubled.
### Cascading Skills
A few skills are cascading skills, with a broad header and multiple sub-skills under this header. An example would be "Small arms" with the Pistol and Rifle skills under this umbrella skill.
A character who receives a cascading skill must decide which one is the primary skill. From then on the primary skill level is the same as the overall skill level.
The other skills are half (rounded down) of what the primary skill is. 
*Example*: A character receives a "Small Arms" skill level of 3 and chooses the primary skill to be Pistols.
The characters Pistol skill is then 3, while Rifle is 1.5 rounded down to 1.

Sometimes it is possible to receive levels in a skill that is not your primary. If this happens, keep track of both skills separately. Though, if the primary skill goes up, the other skills also go up according to the rules stated before.
*If* a non-primary skill level exceeds the primary skill level, the non-primary skill becomes the new primary skill.
