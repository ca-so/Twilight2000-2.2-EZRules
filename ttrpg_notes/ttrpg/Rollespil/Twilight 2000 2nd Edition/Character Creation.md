Here are the character sheets:
[Character Sheet Usable](./PDF%20Locations/Twilight%202000%202nd/Twilight%202000%20-%20Character%20Sheet%2001.pdf)
[Character Sheet Unusable](./PDF%20Locations/Twilight%202000%202nd/Twilight%202000%20-%20Character%20Sheet%2002.pdf)

This is what we have to go through to create a character:
- Background: Decide on nationality, gender and name
- Attributes: Find characters stats with either rolled or point-buy
- Experience: Simulate your characters life from 17 years old and forward
- Derived values: The last stats are calculated
- Equipment: What gear your character has collected over the years

# Background
The first thing to do is name your character and what gender you will be.
## Nationality and army
What nationality you choose decides which languages you might be able to speak, so choose carefully.
Here you can see what languages you get from the different nationalities:
![[languages_for_nationalities.png]]

The first language in the column is your native language. You receive an automatic 10 in that language and can add that to your character sheet.
Now you can see if you get any additional languages.
You go from top to bottom through the potential languages and roll 1d10. You keep doing this either until you succeed in one language or fail all potential languages.
You succeed by rolling the displayed number or below.
If you succeed, you get a 10 in that language and can add it to your character sheet.

You then choose an army appropriate for your nationality. You can have a different nationality than what army you are in (ex. be Italian but be in the U.S. Army).
Just make sure to clear it with your GM first.

## Soviet nationalities and army
I got to be honest, I don't understand the rules for how Soviet stuff works. If you want to play as that, we can figure something out together

# Attributes
Each character is described by six attributes: Strength, Agility, Constitution, Charisma, Intelligence and Education.
These can be determined either with a point-buy system or by rolling

## Point-buy
When using point-buy, you have a total of 32 points to distribute over your characters attributes.
No attribute can have a value of 0 or higher than 10.
## Random Generation
For each attribute, roll 2d6-2 and reroll any roll that would result in a stat being 0.
You can choose yourself if you want to move the stats around or randomly generate in order.
## Increasing Attributes And Meaning
Attributes may be permanently changed during the experience part of character creation but do not change (only temporarily) as a result of gameplay.
No attribute may be increased by more than 2 during the experience part of character creation, making the highest possible stat = 12.

Strength: How big your muscles are
Agility: Your coordination and nimbleness
Constitution: Health and stamina
Intelligence: How quickly you learns. Is **NOT** the same thing as common sense
Education: How far you are able to get in an academic setting
Charisma: How attractive and trustworthy you are

# Experience
Okay, this one is a bit harder to explain properly.

A few things:
A background consists of a formal education and/or one or more careers.

Backgrounds are calculated in periods of 4 year terms.

A character can enter any career that they meet the requirements for, but they have to spend a full term doing that thing, before being able to change career.

### Step 1:
Your character starts out as 17 years old. You pick 4 skills from the following list and receive 2 levels in each. 
Add this to your character sheet.
![[background_skill_list.png]]
### Step 2:
You pick any career that your character meets the requirements for and work in that career for as many terms as you want, given that war does not break out.
For the 1st term in a career, your character gains a fixed amount of skill levels. In the following terms in the same career, they gain bonus skill levels that they freely can distribute between the available skills, as show in this picture:

![[term_skill_levels.png]]
*There are some additional rules for these extra skill levels, but I have decided that they are too complicated for no reason. They have therefore been removed.*

Will eventually upload pictures here, but you can in the meantime find it on page 31 in the core rulebook PDF.

### Step 3:
Once you have chosen a career and a secondary activity, added all the stats from that term, it is time to roll to see if you get promoted! Not all careers have promotions, but if they do they will have a special Promotion tab listed.

A character is eligible for promotion once per term.
I am a bit unsure on how promotions work, but as far as I understand you roll 1d10 and if you roll the same or higher than your promotion number, you gain a promotion.
I think a bonus might be added (listed as DM +x) if your character meets certain requirements.
If a character is promoted, you gain 1 additional skill in any of the available skills under your career.

### Step 4:
One last thing to roll.
At the end of each term, roll 1d10 to see if war breaks out.
If that roll is equal to or less than your current term number, then war breaks out.

When war breaks out, everyone already in the military gets an automatic promotion and can roll for a second.
Everyone else gets to roll for one.

Everyone gets drafted into the military and receives basic training, unless it specifically says they do not in their career, and pick a military career they can have 1 term in. 

### Secondary Activities
Your characters career does not take up 100% of their time.
Most careers allow 1 secondary activity.
Some allow none and some allow 2.
This allows the player to take one level in any skill on the following list

![[secondary_activities.png]]
### Languages
Why this rule exists, I do not know..

Any skill level received in a language in the same group as your native tongue, is doubled.
### Cascading Skills
A few skills are cascading skills, with a broad header and multiple sub-skills under this header. An example would be "Small arms" with the Pistol and Rifle skills under this umbrella skill.
A character who receives a cascading skill must decide which one is the primary skill. From then on the primary skill level is the same as the overall skill level.
The other skills is half (rounded down) of what the primary skill is. 
*Example*: A character receives a "Small Arms" skill level of 3 and chooses the primary skill to be Pistols.
The characters Pistol skill is then 3, while Rifle is 1.5 rounded down to 1.

Sometimes it is possible to receive levels in a skill that is not your primary. If this happens, keep track of both skills separately. Though, if the primary skill goes up, the other skills also go up according to the rules stated before.
*If* a non-primary skill level exceeds the primary skill level, the non-primary skill becomes the new primary skill.

### Basic Training
All characters who have a military career, receive basic training. This skill bonus can only be added once and is added on top of what ever skills are gained during the first term in the military.

### Contacts
As part of your characters background and job(s), they may gain contacts around the world.
These contacts can either be a generic contact or a solid contact.

Generic Contacts:
These are assigned during the characters creation. These are listed as what they did before the war.
There are some examples of what a character might be doing after the war in the [Core Rulebook PDF](./PDF%20Locations/Twilight%202000%202nd/Twilight%202000%20-%20Corebook%20-%20Core%20Rulebook%20v2.2%20%7BGDW2000%7D.pdf) on page 23.

Solid Contacts:
This is a contact that has been fledged out more and has been given skills, attributes, a suitable background history and so fourth.
A solid contact can not be made into a generic contact, but a generic contact can become a solid one.
This is mostly for the referee, as to use them more in the storytelling.
# Derived Values
### Initiative
To determine initiative, regulars (people actively in the military) roll 1d6, reservists (people previously in the military) roll 1d6+2 and draftees roll 1d6-2. Any roll equal to 0 is rerolled.
Add 1 to this roll if character is a ranger, airborne, special forces, force recon, sniper or equivalent.
Subtract 1 from this roll is character is support, air force enlisted, aviation enlisted or military intelligence (but never make initiative go below 1).

### Rads
Since nuclear bombs have been dropped recently, every character has some form of radiation damage. However no character will begin with either serious or lethal exposure levels.
To determine the rads level of a character who was military pre-war, roll a number of D6's twice their initiative.
To determine the rads level of a character who was not military pre-war, roll a D6 and a D10 and multiply these numbers together.

### Age
As previously stated, every character starts at the age of 17.
Multiply your number of terms by 4 and add 17 to that number to get your characters current age.

Beginning from age 33, the effects of age start effecting your character, i.e. beginning at the end of your 4th term.

At the end of your 4th and 5th term, roll 1D10 to check for losses in agility.
At the end of your 6th and 7th term, roll 2D10 to check for losses in both agility and strength.
At the end of your 8th term and fourth, roll 3D10 to check for losses in agility, strength and constitution.
And finally, at the end of your 12th term, roll 4D10 to check for losses in agility, strength, constitution and intelligence.

The character loses 1 point from the relevant attribute if the D10 roll is less than the current level of the attribute.

These same rules also count when aging during play.

### Skill And Attribute Derived Values
Now we can calculate the rest.
#### Hit Capacity:
This is your characters health and shows how much damage they can take in all their body parts.

The HP of the following body parts are calculated like this:
Head: Constitution X 2
Chest: (Strength + Constitution) X 3
Arms and legs: (Strength + Constitution) X 2

#### Weight
Weight for male characters is calculated as follows and is measured in Kg:
(4 X (Strength - Agility)) + 80

Weight for female character is calculated as follows and is measured in Kg:
(4 X (Strength - Agility)) + 65
#### Carrying Capacity:
A character can carry (Strength + Constitution) X 3 in Kg, without being heavily burdened.

A character may carry up to twice that, but is then burdened and will have their movement speed reduced.
(Insert link to rule here when written)

#### Throw Range
This is the range a character can throw something that weighs 1 Kg accurately.
This is 4 X Strength in meters.
#### Unarmed Combat Damage
This is how much damage your character can do without a weapon.
This is calculated like this:
(Unarmed Martial Arts skills X Strength) / 10
This number is rounded down, unless it is equal to 0, then set it to 1.
This number determines how much damage a character will do per attack.
# Equipment
So, now to equip your character.
Every character begins the game with a basic set and is able to buy additional equipment as well.

You first start with a basic load of equipment, any personal belongings and a personal weapon.
### The Basic Load
The basic load is as follows:
1 X  fatigues
1 X steel helmet
1 X backpack
1 X shelter half
1 X gas mask
1 X combat webbing set
1 X bayonet
6 X magazines for personal weapon
6 X frag grenades
2 X smoke grenades
180 X loose rounds for personal weapon

Additionally, officers and vehicle crewmembers receive a sidearm and 3 X full magazines for the sidearm
Note: US officers may only choose an M9 or M1911A1.

American quartermasters are a bit more generous, so US characters receive an additional:
1 X sleeping bag
1 X flashlight
1 X personal med-kit
1 X thermal fatigues
1 X kevlar vest

The personal weapons can be chosen from page 51 in the [Core Rulebook PDF](./PDF%20Locations/Twilight%202000%202nd/Twilight%202000%20-%20Corebook%20-%20Core%20Rulebook%20v2.2%20%7BGDW2000%7D.pdf)
The stats for the basic load can be found on page 64 in the PDF.
A character may only choose a weapon from the country that are from during creation.
### Transportation And Animals
Only a party of 3 characters or more may roll for getting a vehicle or animal.
For each group of 3 players, they get 1D6 to roll on the vehicle or animal table.
Players may combine these dice, to be able to score higher on the table. However they can not combine above 3D6.

Characters in services making special use of vehicles do NOT automatically receive a vehicle.

Vehicles come with a full tank of alcohol fuel and a full load of ammunition. 
The carrying capacity of a vehicle can be seen on the vehicle cards, starting page 65, as the number "Load".
![[vehicle_roll_table.png]]

When rolling for animals, each D6 counts for how many animals the party owns. These can be found on page 89. However, which animals the party can choose is up to the referee, as it needs to fit the current setting the game is in.

### Buying Equipment
To calculate how much money your character starts with, is as follows:
Terms in military X 5000
If your character is an officer:
Terms in military X 10000

Note that even civilian characters receive 1 term of money from the military.

What equipment is available can be seen on from page 249 to 252.

Since your characters usually start the game on the run, only equipment that can be carried or stored in the vehicle can be bought.

If a new character is introduced, they cannot spawn with a vehicle (except with a motorcycle or similar) and can only carry the equipment they can carry on their person.
However, the referee will usually allow the extra equipment they want to buy, to be airdropped in close by.
