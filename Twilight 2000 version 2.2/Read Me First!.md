# For The Players
A suggestion is to read the following in the core rulebook, to get a basic understanding of the game:
- **Introduction**: Page 6 -14
- **Character Creation**: Page 15 - 24
- **Skills And Equipment**: Page 47 - 64
- **Mechanics**: Page 131 - 135

HOWEVER!
I am going to make a guide for everything, so you easily can look it all up in easy to navigate folders.
Because wow. you can really feel how old the core rule book is.

# For The GM
For GM'ing, you should read the same pages as the players and the following:
- **Structure**: Page 93 - 135
- **Encounters**: Page 154 - 170
- **Combat Rules**: Page 198 - 223
- **Flavour**: Page 223 - 246
- **Technical Tables**: Page 211 - 222

Anyway, will also make easily accessible guides for what the GM needs :3
