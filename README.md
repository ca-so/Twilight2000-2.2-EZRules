This is an easy overview/guide to the rules of Twilight:2000 2.2 edition.

Everything from the original PDF's, to guides on how to do everything in the game is there (or will be added if it's not there yet).

Here is a guide on how to set it all up as well, including how to download the files:

Sorry for using Google Docs, did not know of any other service that I could easily use :C


I don't own the copyright to any of the PDF's used, but have aquired them legally.
If you are the owner of the rights to the PDF files and want them removed or otherwise changed, please send me an e-mail at ca-so@kollektiv.email

If you have any questions about how to open the files, edits to make because I wrote something wrong or just want to help this project, feel free to also contact me at ca-so@kolletiv.email

Hope you enjoy! 
Happy playing :))
