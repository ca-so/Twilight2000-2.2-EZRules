This is an easy overview/guide to the rules of Twilight:2000 2.2 edition.

Open the folder "ttrpg_notes", then "ttrpg". Then open the folder "Rollespil" in Obsidian, and it should work! Will make this process easier soon, so you don't need to navigate so many folders first.

You only need to download the folder "ttrpg_notes" and use it as a vault in Obsidian. 
Everything from the original PDF's, to guides on how to do everything in the game is there (or will be added if it's not there yet).

I don't the copyright to any of the PDF's used, but have aquired them legally.
If you are the owner of the rights to the PDF files and want them removed or otherwise changed, please send me an e-mail at ca-so@kollektiv.email
If you have any questions about how to open the files, edits to make because I wrote something wrong or just want to help this project, feel free to also contact me at ca-so@kolletiv.email

Hope you enjoy! 
Happy playing :))
