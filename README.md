This is an easy overview/guide to the rules of Twilight:2000 2.2 edition.

Open these files in Obsidian to view them.

You only need to download the folder "ttrpg_notes" and use it as a vault in Obsidian. Everything from the original PDF's to guides on how to do everything is there (or will be added if it's not there yet)


I don't the copyright to any of the PDF's used, but have aquired them legally.
